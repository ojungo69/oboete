# Anchor-peer deployment with Sharing domains

An **anchor peer** is a normal codemem peer that happens to have high uptime. It
is useful as a stable sync backstop for laptops, but it is not a coordinator,
gateway, quorum node, backbone tier, or special protocol role.

The rules are the same as for every other peer:

- The peer has its own device key and local SQLite database.
- It only receives memories for Sharing domains where it has explicit scope
  membership.
- Project include/exclude filters can narrow what it receives, but they cannot
  grant access.
- The coordinator can help devices discover the anchor peer, but memory payloads
  still move directly peer-to-peer.
- If the anchor peer is revoked from a Sharing domain, it stops receiving future
  sync for that domain. Already-copied data on its disk is not erased.

## Deployment shapes

### Solo local use

No anchor peer is needed. One device writes to its local SQLite database. Keep
unknown projects local-only until you intentionally map them to a Sharing domain.

### Personal multi-device sync

Use a personal Sharing domain, for example `personal:owner`, and grant only your
own devices to it. A home server or small VPS can join that personal domain
as an anchor peer if you want memories available when laptops sleep.

Recommended shape:

- laptop: member of `personal:owner`
- desktop: member of `personal:owner`
- always-on anchor peer: member of `personal:owner`
- coordinator: optional discovery plane, not a data path

### Small team VPS

For a small team, run one always-on peer on a VPS and grant it only to the team
domains it should hold, such as `acme-work`. Do not grant it to personal or
client domains unless it intentionally needs those memories.

Recommended shape:

- teammates' laptops: members of `acme-work`
- VPS anchor peer: member of `acme-work`
- optional OSS domain: separate `oss-codemem` membership if the VPS should hold
  OSS memories too
- coordinator: can run on the same VPS for discovery/admin, but it remains
  separate from the anchor peer's local memory database

### Organization with three always-on peers

For higher availability, run three always-on peers. They are still three normal
peers, not a quorum cluster. Each peer has a local SQLite database and syncs via
the same peer protocol as laptops.

Recommended shape:

- three k8s pods or VMs running codemem as regular peers
- each peer has explicit membership in the org/team Sharing domains it should
  hold
- each peer has durable local storage if you want it to survive restarts without
  a full re-bootstrap
- laptops sync with whichever peer is reachable; the always-on peers converge
  with each other through normal peer sync

If one always-on peer dies, the remaining peers continue holding their local
copies. A replacement peer should be enrolled, granted the intended Sharing
domains, and bootstrapped from existing peers.

## Storage and backups

Anchor peers are local-first peers, so restoring their identity requires one
coherent backup set:

- the effective SQLite database selected by `--db-path` or `CODEMEM_DB`
- `<keys-dir>/device.key`, the secret Ed25519 private key
- `<keys-dir>/device.key.pub`, the corresponding public key
- the effective config selected by `--config`, `CODEMEM_CONFIG`, or the configured
  runtime root, or equivalent environment settings that select the same database,
  key directory, coordinator, and listener configuration

Protect the database and config as sensitive data and the private key as a
credential. Never publish the private key, coordinator secrets, invite tokens, or
an unredacted config snapshot as diagnostic artifacts.

Use durable storage for the complete set. Prefer a filesystem or volume snapshot
taken while codemem is stopped, or use SQLite-safe backup tooling. Copying only
the main database file while it is active in WAL mode can omit committed state.
`CODEMEM_RUNTIME_ROOT` selects workspace config; it does not automatically move
the database or key directory, so set `CODEMEM_DB`, `CODEMEM_CONFIG`, and
`CODEMEM_KEYS_DIR` explicitly when restoring to new paths.

Before starting a restored peer, stop or isolate the old instance. Running two
instances with the same private key clones one device identity. Then verify that
the replacement reports the original device ID and fingerprint, refreshes
coordinator presence, authenticates a signed peer request, and completes a direct
sync. If the database is present but the private key is missing, invalid, or from
another identity, codemem fails closed instead of silently rotating the key,
unless the matching private key remains in the configured platform keychain.

The protected `device.key` file is the portable restore artifact even when
`CODEMEM_SYNC_KEY_STORE=keychain` is enabled; codemem can repopulate the keychain
from a matching restored file. If an operator deliberately removes that file and
keeps the credential only in the platform keychain, it can authenticate only on
that local platform; migrate the credential with platform-supported secure tooling
before moving the peer. The database and public-key file alone are never sufficient.

If you use ephemeral storage, the peer can still be useful as a cache/backstop
while it is running, but it must re-bootstrap after restart.

## Granting scopes intentionally

Coordinator group enrollment is not enough. Grant the anchor peer to each
Sharing domain explicitly:

```fish
codemem coordinator grant-scope-member team-alpha acme-work <anchor-device-id> --effect-id <effect-id> --db-path ~/.codemem/coordinator.sqlite
codemem coordinator grant-scope-member team-alpha oss-codemem <anchor-device-id> --effect-id <effect-id> --db-path ~/.codemem/coordinator.sqlite
```

Effect ids make membership mutations deterministic and idempotent; use a stable unique value for each intended mutation.

Review grants regularly:

```fish
codemem coordinator list-scope-members team-alpha acme-work --db-path ~/.codemem/coordinator.sqlite
```

Revoke a domain when the anchor peer should stop receiving future data for it:

```fish
codemem coordinator revoke-scope-member team-alpha acme-work <anchor-device-id> --effect-id <effect-id> --db-path ~/.codemem/coordinator.sqlite
```

Revocation is forward-looking. Rotate or destroy the anchor peer's local storage
if you need to remove data already copied there.

## What not to build around

- Do not assume an anchor peer is authoritative for a Sharing domain.
- Do not require a quorum of anchor peers for writes.
- Do not route memory payloads through the coordinator.
- Do not use project filters as a substitute for Sharing-domain grants.
- Do not put personal and work data on the same anchor peer unless both domains
  are intentionally granted to that peer.

The mental model is Syncthing-shaped: durable always-on devices improve
availability because they are online often, not because the protocol gives them
special powers.
