# Milestone 1: freeze and label

The plan is docs/milestone-1-plan.md. The spec is docs/spec.md §8.1-8.4. Evaluation data lives only in ~/.oboete/eval (owner-only files); this note holds the rules, seeds and numbers.

## Frozen inputs

`python3 docs/eval/freeze.py check` must print `ok` before any later script runs. freeze.json lists each file's sha256.

| File | What | Frozen |
|---|---|---|
| queries.jsonl | the 424 questions: dev 312, test 112 (test: Japanese prompts 104, English prompts 6, English agent searches 1, Japanese agent searches 1) | Task 1 |
| claude-mem-2026-09-24.db | the copy the evaluation store and the 424 questions came from; newest session 2026-09-24T00:44:49Z | Task 1 |
| queries-en.jsonl | M21's 53 new English test questions from 51 test-side sessions, unjudged until milestone 4 (Appendix C item 13, A86) | Task 2 |

The evaluation store (~/.oboete/eval/home/oboete.db) is rebuilt from the copy, so it is recorded by counts (2026-09-26): 152,136 observations, 13,169 summaries, 13,197 prompts, highest observation id 152,136. That is 178,502 documents, the store D2 was measured on (docs/pr-d.md:14). docs/pr-b.md's B1 counts (152,030 / 13,155 / 13,185) describe an earlier state of the same store.

## Seeds

Every draw orders candidates by sha256 of `<purpose>:oboete-milestone-1-2026-09-26:<id>` (docs/eval/common.py SEED).

## The unseen final set (spec 8.1), sealed now, drawn at milestone 8

- Source: a fresh read-only copy of claude-mem's database taken at milestone 8, imported into a new evaluation home; questions built with build_queries.py's filters.
- Sessions: only those whose `sdk_sessions.started_at` is after 2026-09-24T00:44:49Z. Excluded: every session behind queries.jsonl, queries-en.jsonl and replay/manifest.json, and any session whose results were seen before milestone 8.
- Size and strata: at least 112 questions, in the test split's proportions: Japanese prompts 104, English prompts 6, English agent searches 1, Japanese agent searches 1, scaled to the drawn size.
- Order: sha256 of `final:oboete-final-2026-09-26:<qid>` within each stratum.
- End-to-end: at least 10 new held-out transcripts from the same period, drawn with replay_set.py's strata and the seed `oboete-final-replay-2026-09-26`.
- Judged only at milestone 8, by a judge that passed calibration. Nobody tunes on it. A failed final run uses the set up (8.1).
- Risk: if claude-mem stops recording before milestone 8, the source becomes the agents' transcripts from the same period, with the same filters; the decision is recorded here when it happens.
